## üçé Want to build for macOS yourself ? 
You can use the script in `derdos_builder/build_mac/run_mac_builder.sh` (Make sure you are running the script within `derdos_builder/build_mac/`)

### Required libraries
- Pyinstaller *(Python 3 required)*
- PyQt6 *(Python 3 required)*
- appdmg *(NodeJs required)*

(`run_mac_builder.sh` will install these automatically)

### An example of building the app on macOS 14

<br>

## ü™ü Want to build for Windows yourself ? 
You can use the script in `derdos_builder/build_mac/run_windows_builder.sh` (Make sure you are running the script within `derdos_builder/build_windows/`)

### Required libraries
- PyQt6 *(Python 3 required)*
- Nuitka *(Python 3 required)*

(`run_windows_builder.bat` will install these automatically)

### An example of building the app on Windows 11
https://github.com/ATOMIC09/DerDoS/assets/66838025/0dccc110-1c75-4078-8783-ac846aab90ea

<br>

## ‚ùì How to use .py version ?
*This section was tested on Windows 11*

Type
```sh
pip install PyQt6
```
in `Command Prompt` or `PowerShell` to install the library that needed to show the GUI

(If you got '`...`' is not recognized as an internal or external command. It means that `...` program is not in your environment PATH)

Then run `main.py`

<br>

## ü§î How to check if it can attack ?

Check-in `Task Manager > Performance > Ethernet`.
If the speed of `Send` is increased, it means it can attack.
But you need to make sure the target doesn't have a firewall on.

<br>

## üõ° How to see if the target has a Firewall on ?

Just use `ping <target_ip>` in command prompt
(e.g. `ping 25.7.233.218` to check if 25.7.233.218 is online or not)
If the packet loss is 100%, the target has a firewall on and you can't attack. or even join the game server

<br>

## üöÄ Example case
You can use the target IP in Hamachi to attack game servers such as Minecraft.
